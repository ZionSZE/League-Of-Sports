    <p><h2><strong>Iran leader says Israeli attack should not be 'exaggerated or downplayed'</strong></h2>
        
    </br>
    <p><h2><em>Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has given a measured response to Israeli strikes on the country, saying the attack should not be "exaggerated or downplayed" while refraining from pledging immediate retaliation.<em><h2>
    </br>
    <img src = "ISRAELI.webp"/>
    <p><h3>>President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran would "give an appropriate response" to the attack, which killed at least four soldiers, adding that Tehran did not seek war.
    
      <p>  Israel said it targeted military sites in several regions of Iran on Saturday in retaliation for Iranian attacks, including a barrage of almost 200 ballistic missiles fired towards Israel on 1 October.
    </br>
     <p> On Sunday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had crippled Iranian air defence and missile production systems. He said the strikes had "severely damaged Iran’s defence capability and its ability to produce missiles".
     </br>  
     <p> "The attack was precise and powerful and achieved its goals," Netanyahu said at a ceremony commemorating the victims of last year's 7 October attacks.
     </br>   
     <p>  "This regime must understand a simple principle: whoever hurts us, we hurt him."
     </br>  
     <p>  Official Iranian sources have publicly played down the impact of the attack, saying most missiles were intercepted and those that weren't caused only limited damage to air defence systems.
     </br>  
    <p> In his first public comments since the attack, Khamenei said: "It is up to the authorities to determine how to convey the power and will of the Iranian people to the Israeli regime and to take actions that serve the interests of this nation and country."
    </br>
     <p>  President Pezeshkian largely echoed the supreme leader's language, telling a cabinet meeting: "We do not seek war, but we will defend the rights of our nation and country."
     </br> 
    <p> The Israeli strikes were more limited than some observers had been expecting. The US had publicly pressured Israel not to hit oil and nuclear facilities, advice seemingly heeded by Tel Aviv.
    </br> 
     <p> The Iranian foreign minister said on Sunday that Iran had "received indications" about an impending attack hours before it took place.
     </br> 
     <p> "We had received indications since the evening about the possibility of an attack that night," Abbas Araghchi told reporters, without going into more detail.
     </br>
    <p> Western countries have urged Iran in turn not to respond in order to break the cycle of escalation between both Middle Eastern countries, which they fear could lead to all-out regional war.
    </br>    
    <p>  Iranian media has carried footage of daily life continuing as normal and framing the "limited" damage as a victory, a choice analysts said was intended to reassure Iranians.
    </br>  
    <p> Fighting continued between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas in Gaza.
    </br>  
    <p>   On Sunday, an Israeli air strike on the town of Sidon in southern Lebanon killed at least eight people, according to local authorities.
    </br>  
    <p> In Gaza, nine people were killed in an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in the al-Shati refugee camp, Palestinians officials said.
    </br>
     <p>Palestinian media and the Reuters news agency said three of the dead were Palestinian journalists, citing government officials.
     </br>
     <p> And in Israel, a man was killed and at least 30 injured after a truck hit a bus stop near an Israeli military base north of Tel Aviv, in what authorities said was a suspected terror attack.
     </br>
    <p>   Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday proposed a two-day ceasefire in Gaza, which would involve an exchange of four Israeli hostages for some Palestinian prisoners.
    </br>
    <p>  He said that within 10 days of implementing such a temporary ceasefire, talks should resume with the aim of reaching a more permanent one.
    </br>
    <p>  But speaking to the BBC's Arabic Service, a senior Hamas official said its conditions for a ceasefire - rejected by Israel for months - have not changed.
    </br>
    <p>    Sami Abu Zuhri said the Palestinian militant group continued to demand a complete ceasefire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a serious prisoner swap deal.
    </br>    
    <p>  "Any agreement that does not guarantee these conditions holds no value," he added.<h3>

    <p><h2><strong>New wave of mass killings in Sudan alarms UN</strong></h2>
    </br>
    <img src="pipi.webp" height="300" width="500"/>
    <p><h2><em>A senior UN official in Sudan says she is deeply troubled by reports of "atrocious crimes" in the central Gezira state, including the mass killing of civilians by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).</em></h2>
    </br>
    <p>Clementine Nkweta-Salami's comments came after an activist group said that at least 124 people were killed by the RSF in attacks on villages over the past week.
    </br>
    <p>   The RSF has denied targeting civilians, saying its fighters are clashing with militias armed by the military.
    </br> 
    <p> The 18-month conflict in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than 11 million.
    </br> 
    <p> Gezira state turned into a major battleground last week after the RSF suffered a major blow when one of its commanders, Abu Aqla Kayka, defected to the military.
    </br> 
    <p>   The army said he had brought "a large number of his forces" with him, in what it described as the first high-profile defection to its side.
    </br> 
    <p>   In response, the RSF said its fighters would defend themselves and "decisively deal with everyone carrying arms".
    </br> 
    <p>   Ms Nkweta-Salami, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, said that preliminary reports suggested that the RSF had carried out a major attack across the state between 20 and 25 October.
    </br> 
    <p>   She added that it led to mass killings, the raping of women and girls, the widespread looting of markets and homes and the burning down of farms.
    </br> 
    <p>   Ms Nkweta-Salami said the "atrocious crimes" were on a scale similar to those seen in Sudan's Darfur region last year, when the RSF was accused of "ethnic cleansing" communities seen to be opposed to it.
    </br> 
    <p>   Ms Nkweta-Salami said the death toll was still unclear, but preliminary reports suggested that scores of people were killed in Gezira state.
    </br> 
    <p>   In a statement on Saturday, the Wad Madani Resistance Committee, which campaigns for an end to the conflict and democratic rule in Sudan, said the RSF was committing "extensive massacres in one village after another", the Reuters news agency reported.
    </br> 
    <p>   The Sudanese doctors' union called on the UN to push the two sides in the conflict to agree to safe humanitarian corridors into villages that were facing "genocide" at the hands of the RSF.
    </br> 
    <p>   The doctors' union added that rescue operations had become impossible and that the army was "incapable" of protecting civilians.
    </br> 
    <p>   The conflict in Sudan broke out in April 2023 after a fall out between the commanders of the RSF and military, Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo and Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan respectively.
    </br> 
    <p>   The two had jointly staged a coup in 2021, derailing Sudan's transition to democracy, but then got involved in a vicious power struggle.
    </br> 
    <p>   The two leaders have refused to sign a peace deal, despite efforts by the US and Saudi Arabia to broker an end to the conflict.

    </br>
    
    <img src = "Harris.jpg"/>
    <p>Donald Trump held a large rally at the iconic Madison Square Garden in his hometown of New York, sticking to a largely familiar script to "bring back the American dream" and showcasing high-profile backers including the world's richest person, Elon Musk
    </br>
    <p>Speeches made by Trump-backers at the event have drawn strong criticism – the former president's childhood friend, David Rem, called Kamala Harris "the devil" and "the antichrist"
    </br>
     <p>    One of the warm-up acts, comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, referred to Puerto Rico as a "floating island of garbage", said Latinos "love making babies", and made a comment about "carving watermelons" at a Halloween party hosted by a black man
     </br>
     <p>    Kamala Harris's campaign, which on the same day laid out its plans to support Puerto Rico, said the rally was "mirroring the same dangerously divisive and demeaning message" as her opponent
     </br>
    <p>    Republicans were also among those criticising the joke about Puerto Rico, with some members of Congress describing it as "racist" and "in poor taste"
    </br>
    <p>    One of Trump's senior advisors distanced the campaign from the joke, saying it did not reflect the views of Trump or his campaign

    <p><h2><em>Missing woman found with snake bite after six days in mountains</em></h2>
    </br>
    <p><h2><strong>Lovisa Sjoberg went missing after driving into the Kosciuszko National Park to take photographs</strong></h2>
    </br>
    <p><h2><strong>A woman missing for six days in Australia’s Snowy Mountains has been found "dazed and injured" by emergency services after a massive search and rescue operation.</strong></h2>
    </br>
    <p>New South Wales (NSW) Police said Lovisa Sjoberg was located on Sunday afternoon local time, suffering from a suspected snake bite, dehydration and a rolled ankle.
    </br>
        The avid photographer was treated for her injuries at the scene, before being rushed to hospital, where she is in a stable condition.
    </br>
        Sjoberg, 48, is a regular visitor to the remote Kosciuszko National Park, where she often documents wild horses living in the mountains.
    </br>
        Fears grew for her safety after a hire car company reported that her car had not been returned and she could not be contacted. Her car was later found unlocked and abandoned.
    </br>
        NSW Police launched an appeal on 21 October to the public to help find her and began a widescale search using sniffer dogs, firefighters, park rangers and a helicopter with infra-red capabilities.
    </br>
        Concerns increased after rescue teams failed to find her after several days and temperatures in the area surrounding Kosciuszko National Park dropped as low as zero degrees at night.
    </br>
        Sjoberg was found on Sunday afternoon local time by a National Parks and Wildlife Service officer on the Nungar Creek Trail at Kiandra.
    </br>
        Supt Toby Lindsay told media that Sjoberg had been "wandering [for] days" through "tough" bushland, and told rescuers she believed she had been bitten by a copperhead snake four days earlier.
    </br>
        The species tends to be shy rather than aggressive, but their venom is a powerful neurotoxin and can be fatal without medical intervention.
    </br>
        “She’s in fact very fortunate to be alive... she obviously went through a tough time," Supt Lindsay said.
    </br>
        He added that she was now in a "reasonable condition" and is " happy to be alive".
